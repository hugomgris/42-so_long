# 42-so_long
so_long project at 42 Barcelona with 125 points.

I implemented static and moving enemies (one persecutor) that can be checked by making in bonus mode (make bonus) and loading the bonus1.ber map inside maps/bonus/. 

I wanted to redraw all the sprites to be able to render everything at higher resolution with crisp images, instead of habing fuzzy and ugly textures in the current version,
as well as implementing a couple of extra mechanics (a dash and a naruto-like, log-spawning teleport), but I ended up deciding it was not worth it. The sprites part would have
taken me a lot of time, and the mechanics were just an unnecessary hustle in a project with a subject that explicitly says something like "don't get stuck in overdo hell, there
are more interesting visual projects down the road". For once, self-care won, so this is my so_long, nothing more, nothing less
